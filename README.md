#1 About
This is a simple Aging algorithm's implementation. This demo maybe is not correct, but i will correct it in future 
when i learn about more.
PS:Aging algorithm is a kind of similar to LRU algorithm, one of Page Replacement Algorithm at Modern Operate System.

#2 Simulation Result
The simulation result is good, which fits the expect.
